***Instructions for use:***

The source data can be obtained from PhysioNet at https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.2/ once the terms of access are met. The csv filenames used in this code match the following default filenames that can be downloaded from the *hosp* folder at the bottom of the page: *"prescriptions.csv", "d_icd_diagnoses.csv", "diagnoses_icd.csv", "d_icd_procedures.csv", "procedures_icd.csv", "labevents.csv", "d_labitems.csv", "microbiologyevents.csv", "poe_detail.csv", "poe.csv", "omr.csv", "admissions.csv", "patients.csv"*, and *"services.csv"*.

This code was written and run using *R* version 4.3.2 and *Python* version 3.12.0, on a laptop computer running macOS Sonoma version 14.5 with an Apple M1 Pro processor, 16GB random-access memory and 10 cores. The code may need to be run in chunks, depending on application memory. The typical run time of all code was approximately 3-4 hours.

Before running the code, the data and *Python* files should be saved into a secure local directory - the filepath of this directory should then be substituted into the file in place of **#FILEPATH#** in all R scripts before running the code. The required package versions are included in the *packages.csv* file within this directory. A conda environment was used to run the *Reticulate* interface package - the local environment used should be substituted for **#CONDAENV_FILEPATH#** in the **PDAST_microsimulation.R**, **PDAST_microsimulation.R**, and **app.R** scripts.

***Reproducing the study***

1. To reproduce the study, all scripts above must be stored in the working directory. The following scripts must be run first:  
   a. **PDAST_packages&settings.R**
   b. **PDAST_cleaning.R**  
   c. **PDAST_feature_engineering.R**  
   d. **PDAST_preprocessing.R**  
   e. **Imports & functions.py**  

Then, for the subsequent analyses:

To reproduce the main model validation, microsimulation study, fairness analysis, and stability analysis:  
2. Run **UDAST_train_test_main.py**  
3. Run **PDAST_microsimulation.R***  
4. Run **PDAST_stability.R**  

To reproduce the model validation sensitivity analysis where organism identification and other AST results are also available:  
2. Run **UDAST_train_test_org_id.py**  
3. Run **UDAST_train_test_AST.py**  
4. Run **PDAST_lab_pathway.R**

To reproduce the analysis where all 'I' results are reclassified as 'R':  
2. Run **UDAST_train_test_I-R.py**  
3. Run **PDAST_microsim_I_sensitivity.R***  

To reproduce the multinomial model validation sensitivity analysis:  
2. Run **UDAST_train_test_multinomial.py**  

To reproduce the out-of-sample time cross validation sensitivity analysis:  
2. Run **PDAST_time_sensitivity.R***  

To reproduce the specimen result clinical contextual analysis:  
2. Run **PDAST_contextual_analysis.R**  

To run the prototype application:  
2. Run **app.R**, using *"session_urines.csv"* as file upload when prompted.  


Scripts marked with asterixes use the *reticulate* interface package to run the *Python* script **Prediction_run.py** within *R*, but the code can alternatively be run by running the *R* script up to the point that *reticulate* is used, running the **Prediction_run.py** file in *Python*, then running the remainder of the *R* script. Remember to substitute in your local directory filepath in place of #FILEPATH#.
